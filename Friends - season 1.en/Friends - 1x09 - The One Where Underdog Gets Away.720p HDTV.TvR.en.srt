1
00:00:05,532 --> 00:00:07,887
Terry, I know I haven't
worked here long. . .

2
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:10,407
. . .but I was wondering,
would it be possible. . .

3
00:00:10,652 --> 00:00:13,610
. . .if I got a $ 100 advance
on my salary?

4
00:00:14,132 --> 00:00:15,360
An advance?

5
00:00:15,652 --> 00:00:17,927
So that I can spend
Thanksgiving with my family.

6
00:00:18,172 --> 00:00:22,211
Every year we ski in Vail, and
my father pays for my ticket. . .

7
00:00:22,452 --> 00:00:25,683
. . .but I've started
this whole independent thing. . .

8
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:28,804
. . .which is actually why
I took this ''job. ''

9
00:00:30,332 --> 00:00:33,085
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart!

10
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:36,206
You're a terrible, terrible waitress.

11
00:00:36,972 --> 00:00:39,486
Really, really awful.

12
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:43,926
I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.

13
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:49,805
But I'm trying really hard,
and I think I'm doing better.

14
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:51,883
I really do.

15
00:00:52,532 --> 00:00:54,488
Does anybody need coffee?

16
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:02,083
The One Where Underdog Gets Away

17
00:01:03,372 --> 00:01:04,361
English Subtitles by
MORPHZ fuckyeah.

18
00:01:49,132 --> 00:01:49,928
Excuse me, sir?

19
00:01:50,172 --> 00:01:52,686
You come in here all the time.
I was wondering. . .

20
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:56,726
. . .is there a possibility that
you could advance me my tips?

21
00:01:59,372 --> 00:02:03,081
That's fine.
Sorry about that spill before!

22
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:06,603
Only 98.50 to go!

23
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:12,328
Did you know Mom and Dad are going
to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?

24
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:14,449
What? No, they're not.

25
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:16,045
The Blymans invited them.

26
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:17,122
You're wrong.

27
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:19,927
I am not wrong.

28
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:21,082
You're wrong.

29
00:02:22,572 --> 00:02:24,130
No, I just talked to them.

30
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:27,007
I'm calling Mom.

31
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:39,401
And this from the Cry for Help
Department: Are you wearing makeup?

32
00:02:41,932 --> 00:02:46,528
Yes, I am. As of today, I'm officially
''Joey Tribbiani: actor/model. ''

33
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:50,605
I was thinking you
look more like ''Joey Tribbiani. . .

34
00:02:50,852 --> 00:02:52,524
. . .man/woman. ''

35
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:55,526
What were you modeling?

36
00:02:55,772 --> 00:02:57,842
You know those posters for
the City Free Clinic?

37
00:02:58,092 --> 00:03:01,482
So you're gonna be one of those
healthy, healthy, healthy guys?

38
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:03,802
The asthma guy's really cute.

39
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:06,290
Know which one you're gonna be?

40
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:08,722
But I hear Lyme disease is open, so. . . .

41
00:03:09,892 --> 00:03:11,803
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.

42
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:13,207
Thanks.

43
00:03:16,732 --> 00:03:19,087
You were right.
How can they do this to us?

44
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,890
It's Thanksgiving!

45
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:23,088
How about if I cook dinner at my place?

46
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:24,765
I'll make it just like Mom's.

47
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:28,090
Will you make the mashed potatoes
with the lumps?

48
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:31,282
They're not actually supposed to--

49
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:33,284
I'll work on the lumps.

50
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,128
Joey, you're going home, right?

51
00:03:36,372 --> 00:03:40,081
Chandler, you're still boycotting
all the pilgrim holidays?

52
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:43,323
Yes. Every single one of them.

53
00:03:43,972 --> 00:03:46,884
-Phoebe, you'll be with your grandma?
-And her boyfriend.

54
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:50,687
But we're celebrating Thanksgiving
in December because he's lunar.

55
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:57,322
So you're free Thursday, then?

56
00:03:57,572 --> 00:03:59,688
Yeah. Oh, can I come?

57
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,323
Rach, you still going to Vail?

58
00:04:03,572 --> 00:04:06,484
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop!

59
00:04:06,732 --> 00:04:08,802
Only $ 1 02 to go.

60
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:10,167
I thought it was 98.50?

61
00:04:10,412 --> 00:04:12,972
Well, it was, but I broke a cup.

62
00:04:14,572 --> 00:04:16,563
Well, I'm off to Carol's.

63
00:04:16,772 --> 00:04:18,683
Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?

64
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:22,286
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife. . .

65
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:26,684
. . .and will probably want to bring
her ooh, ooh, lesbian life-partner.

66
00:04:36,452 --> 00:04:37,521
Is Carol here?

67
00:04:37,772 --> 00:04:39,808
No, she's at a faculty meeting.

68
00:04:41,172 --> 00:04:43,891
I just came by to pick up my skull.

69
00:04:44,092 --> 00:04:46,208
Well, not mine, but. . . .

70
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:48,091
Come in.

71
00:04:48,572 --> 00:04:52,611
Carol borrowed it for a class, and I
have to get it back to the museum.

72
00:04:52,852 --> 00:04:53,807
What's it look like?

73
00:04:54,532 --> 00:04:56,807
Kind of like a big face without skin.

74
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:02,524
I'm familiar with the concept.

75
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:04,683
You can just look for it.

76
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:15,084
You guys sure have a lot of books
about being a lesbian.

77
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:21,127
You know, you have to take a course.

78
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:24,763
Otherwise they don't let you do it.

79
00:05:33,972 --> 00:05:36,645
Yertle the Turtle!
A classic.

80
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:39,486
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.

81
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:44,564
The baby that hasn't been born yet?

82
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,882
Wouldn't that mean you're. . .

83
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:48,281
. . .crazy?

84
00:05:49,452 --> 00:05:52,285
What? You don't think they can
hear sounds in there?

85
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:54,927
You're not serious? I mean. . .

86
00:05:55,172 --> 00:05:56,605
. . .you really talk to it?

87
00:05:57,132 --> 00:06:00,363
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.

88
00:06:01,572 --> 00:06:03,449
Do you talk about me?

89
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:06,248
All the time.

90
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:07,288
Really?

91
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:12,289
We just refer to you
as ''Bobo, the sperm guy. ''

92
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:27,482
If she's talking to it, I just think
I should get some belly-time too.

93
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:29,888
Not that I believe any of this.

94
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:33,568
I believe it. I think the baby can
totally hear everything.

95
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:36,563
I'll show you.
This will seem a little weird.

96
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:40,202
But you put your head
inside this turkey. . .

97
00:06:40,452 --> 00:06:43,489
. . .and we'll all talk and you'll
hear everything we say.

98
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:48,887
I'd just like to say I'm totally
behind this experiment.

99
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:53,082
In fact, I'd very much like
to butter your head.

100
00:06:58,172 --> 00:07:00,732
-Did you make your money?
-Not even close.

101
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:02,883
Forget Vail.
Forget seeing my family.

102
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:06,488
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.

103
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:11,121
Here's your mail.

104
00:07:11,372 --> 00:07:13,488
Thanks. You can just
put it on the table.

105
00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:17,283
Here's your mail!

106
00:07:18,132 --> 00:07:21,488
Thanks. You can just
put it on the table!

107
00:07:21,972 --> 00:07:23,690
Would you just open it!

108
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:28,089
Oh, my God!

109
00:07:28,332 --> 00:07:31,290
You guys are great!

110
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,563
We all chipped in.

111
00:07:33,772 --> 00:07:34,727
We did?

112
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:36,530
You owe me $20.

113
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:39,121
Thank you. Thank you so much!

114
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:40,441
Chandler, here you go.

115
00:07:40,692 --> 00:07:43,047
Your traditional holiday feast.
Tomato soup. . .

116
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:47,126
. . .grilled-cheese fixings and
your family-size bag of Funyuns.

117
00:07:47,372 --> 00:07:49,602
This is your Thanksgiving dinner?

118
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:52,286
What is it with you
and this holiday?

119
00:07:53,732 --> 00:07:55,051
I'm 9 years old.

120
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:56,771
I hate this story!

121
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:58,889
We've just finished
Thanksgiving dinner.

122
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:00,923
I have-- I remember
this part vividly--

123
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:03,128
--a mouthful of pumpkin pie.

124
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:07,126
And this is the moment my parents
tell me they're getting divorced.

125
00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:08,606
Oh, my God!

126
00:08:08,852 --> 00:08:13,084
Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving
dinner once you've seen it in reverse.

127
00:08:31,372 --> 00:08:32,930
We used to work together.

128
00:08:33,172 --> 00:08:34,048
We did?

129
00:08:34,772 --> 00:08:37,684
At Macy's. You're
the Obsession girl, right?

130
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:40,283
I was the Aramis guy.

131
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:44,092
Aramis? Aramis?

132
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:46,327
Yeah, right!

133
00:08:47,132 --> 00:08:49,362
You're the best in the business.

134
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,091
-Get out!
-I'm serious!

135
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:55,291
You're amazing! You know when to
spritz. You know when to lay back.

136
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:59,082
Really? You don't know
what that means to me.

137
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:04,768
You smell great tonight.
What are you wearing?

138
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:07,564
Nothing.

139
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:18,567
Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?

140
00:09:18,812 --> 00:09:21,485
Yeah, that would be--

141
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:25,730
-What's wrong?
-I remembered I have to do something.

142
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:27,691
What?

143
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:31,451
Leave.

144
00:09:31,652 --> 00:09:33,688
Wait, wait, wait!

145
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:15,771
I guess you all saw it.

146
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:18,128
Saw what?

147
00:10:18,532 --> 00:10:21,922
We're just laughing. You know
how laughter can be infectious.

148
00:10:40,892 --> 00:10:44,646
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.

149
00:10:46,452 --> 00:10:48,727
''Tonight, on a very special Blossom. ''

150
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,005
Looking good! Okay!

151
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:06,484
Cider's mulling, turkey's
turking, yams are yamming. . . .

152
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:08,526
What?

153
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:12,402
I don't know. It's just not
the same without Mom in the kitchen.

154
00:11:13,252 --> 00:11:15,766
That's it. Get out of
my way and stop annoying me!

155
00:11:16,012 --> 00:11:17,491
Well, that's closer.

156
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:20,485
I got the tickets!

157
00:11:20,732 --> 00:11:24,520
Five hours from now,
shoop, shoop, shoop!

158
00:11:24,772 --> 00:11:27,127
Oh, you must stop shooping.

159
00:11:27,372 --> 00:11:29,283
I'm gonna get my stuff.

160
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:31,644
Will you just come in, already?

161
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:35,362
I prefer to keep a safe distance
from all this merriment.

162
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,684
Look out! Incoming pumpkin pie!

163
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:48,886
We all laughed when you did it with
the stuffing, but that's not funny.

164
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:54,042
Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any Tater Tots.

165
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:55,890
That's not a question.

166
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:58,892
But my mom always makes them.
It's a tradition.

167
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:02,886
A piece of turkey on your fork,
a little cranberry sauce and a Tot!

168
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:05,482
I mean it's. . .

169
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:10,284
. . .bad enough I can't be with
my family, because of my disease.

170
00:12:12,052 --> 00:12:12,928
All right. Fine.

171
00:12:13,172 --> 00:12:16,323
Tonight's potatoes will be both
mashed with lumps. . .

172
00:12:16,572 --> 00:12:18,688
. . .and in the form of Tots.

173
00:12:21,012 --> 00:12:23,367
I'm off to talk to my unborn child.

174
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:27,284
Mom never hit.

175
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:33,490
Okay, all done.

176
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:37,090
Phoebe, did you whip the pota--?

177
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:38,691
Ross needs lumps!

178
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,723
Oh, I'm sorry!
I just--

179
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:45,688
I thought we could have them whipped
and then add some peas and onions.

180
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,481
Why would we do that?

181
00:12:47,732 --> 00:12:50,121
Then they'd be like
my mom used to make it. . .

182
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:51,600
. . .before she died.

183
00:12:55,172 --> 00:12:57,891
Three kinds of potatoes coming up.

184
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:01,169
Goodbye, you guys!

185
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:02,481
Thanks for everything!

186
00:13:02,732 --> 00:13:06,486
Oh, God, look at-- Sorry!
I'm so sorry.

187
00:13:08,132 --> 00:13:11,727
The most unbelievable thing has
happened! Underdog has gotten away!

188
00:13:11,932 --> 00:13:12,728
The balloon?

189
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:15,447
No, the actual cartoon character.

190
00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:18,848
Of course the balloon!

191
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:20,491
It's all over the news.

192
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:24,441
He broke free and was spotted
over Washington Square Park.

193
00:13:24,652 --> 00:13:26,210
I'm going to the roof.
Who's with me?

194
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:27,805
I can't. I gotta go!

195
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:31,488
An 80-foot dog loose over the city?
How often does that happen?

196
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:33,284
Almost never.

197
00:13:33,852 --> 00:13:34,887
Got the keys?

198
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:42,646
Anytime you're ready!

199
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,284
Okay, here we go.

200
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:54,491
Where am I talking to here?

201
00:13:55,852 --> 00:14:00,084
There is one way that seems to offer
a certain acoustical advantage, but. . . .

202
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:02,805
Just aim for the bump.

203
00:14:07,732 --> 00:14:09,290
Okay, here goes.

204
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:18,928
You know, I can't do this.

205
00:14:20,132 --> 00:14:22,168
It's too weird. I feel stupid.

206
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:26,966
It's fine. You don't have to do it
just because Susan does it.

207
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,483
Hello, baby!

208
00:14:32,492 --> 00:14:36,121
--the moment we first saw the giant dog
shadow fall over the park!

209
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:39,409
But did they have to shoot him down?
That was just mean.

210
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:44,402
Right about now the turkey should
be crispy on the outside. . .

211
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:46,290
. . .and juicy on the inside.

212
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:49,484
Why are we standing here?

213
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:52,968
We're waiting for you to open
the door. You've got the keys.

214
00:14:53,172 --> 00:14:54,685
No, I don't.

215
00:14:55,972 --> 00:14:59,521
Yes, you do. When we left,
you said, ''Got the keys. ''

216
00:15:00,092 --> 00:15:01,889
No, I didn't. I asked. . .

217
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:04,248
. . . ''Got the keys?''

218
00:15:05,732 --> 00:15:07,962
You said, ''Got the keys! ''

219
00:15:08,212 --> 00:15:10,885
Either of you have the keys?

220
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:13,282
The oven is on!

221
00:15:13,492 --> 00:15:14,971
I've gotta get my ticket!

222
00:15:15,212 --> 00:15:16,850
Wait! We have a copy of your key.

223
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:18,081
Then get it!

224
00:15:18,332 --> 00:15:20,562
That tone won't make me go any faster.

225
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:23,086
That one will.

226
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:30,290
And everyone's telling me,
''You gotta pick a major! ''

227
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:34,286
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.

228
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:40,487
And you have no idea what I'm saying,
because, let's face it, you're a fetus.

229
00:15:41,972 --> 00:15:44,691
You're just happy you don't
have gills anymore.

230
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:48,811
You don't have to talk to it.
You can sing to it.

231
00:15:49,052 --> 00:15:51,612
Please. I am not singing
to your stomach.

232
00:15:53,372 --> 00:15:54,805
How's it going?

233
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:56,883
Here we come

234
00:15:57,092 --> 00:15:58,889
Walking down the street

235
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:02,920
Get the funniest looks from
Everyone we meet

236
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,491
Hey, hey--

237
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:10,325
-Did you feel that?
-I did.

238
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:12,722
-Does it always--?
-That was the first!

239
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,485
Keep singing! Keep singing!

240
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:17,483
Hey, hey, you're my baby

241
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:20,487
And I can 't wait to meet you

242
00:16:20,692 --> 00:16:24,480
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel
And then we'll go to the zoo

243
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:26,970
I felt it that time!

244
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:28,531
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy

245
00:16:28,772 --> 00:16:31,491
I'm the one without any breasts

246
00:16:35,372 --> 00:16:36,487
Not that one.

247
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:38,324
Can you go any faster?

248
00:16:38,572 --> 00:16:42,485
I got one keyhole and a zillion keys!
You do the math.

249
00:16:42,732 --> 00:16:45,485
Why do you guys have so many
keys in there anyway?

250
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:48,081
For an emergency just like this.

251
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:51,766
All right. Listen, smirky!

252
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,923
If it wasn't for your stupid balloon. . .

253
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:58,768
. . .I'd be on a plane watching a woman
do this right now. But I'm not!

254
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:02,411
I swear you said you had the keys!

255
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:05,212
I wouldn't say I had the
keys unless I had the keys!

256
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,323
I obviously did not have the keys!

257
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:10,484
That's it! Enough with the keys.
No one say ''keys'' !

258
00:17:13,052 --> 00:17:15,282
Why would I have the keys!

259
00:17:15,932 --> 00:17:17,843
Besides the fact that
you said you did?

260
00:17:18,052 --> 00:17:20,202
-But I didn't!
-Well, you should have.

261
00:17:20,452 --> 00:17:21,601
-Why?
-Because!

262
00:17:21,812 --> 00:17:23,882
Because everything's
my responsibility?

263
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:26,447
Isn't it enough that I'm making
Thanksgiving dinner?

264
00:17:26,692 --> 00:17:30,605
Everyone wants a different potato,
so I'm making different potatoes.

265
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:34,686
Does anybody care what kind
of potatoes I want?

266
00:17:37,532 --> 00:17:40,330
Just as long as Phoebe gets
her peas and onions. . .

267
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:42,483
. . .and Mario gets his Tots.

268
00:17:42,932 --> 00:17:45,207
It's my first Thanksgiving, and I--

269
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:49,007
It's all burnt, and I can't. . . .

270
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:53,602
Monica, only dogs can hear you now.

271
00:17:53,852 --> 00:17:56,286
Look, the door's open!
Here we go.

272
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,488
The turkey's burnt!

273
00:18:04,772 --> 00:18:08,287
Potatoes are ruined! Potatoes
are ruined! Potatoes are ruined!

274
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:10,520
Here we come

275
00:18:10,972 --> 00:18:12,883
Walking down the--

276
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:17,282
This doesn't smell like Mom's.

277
00:18:19,212 --> 00:18:21,601
It doesn't, does it?
But you wanted lumps.

278
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:23,968
Well, here you go, buddy.
You got one!

279
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:27,686
God, this is great!

280
00:18:27,892 --> 00:18:31,009
The plane is gone, so I guess
I'm stuck here with you guys.

281
00:18:31,252 --> 00:18:35,086
We all had better plans, okay?
This was nobody's first choice!

282
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:36,281
Oh, really?

283
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:40,366
So why was I busting my ass
to make this delicious dinner?

284
00:18:40,612 --> 00:18:41,647
You call that delicious?

285
00:18:45,052 --> 00:18:46,770
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

286
00:18:47,532 --> 00:18:49,648
Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.

287
00:19:04,332 --> 00:19:05,242
What?

288
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:08,848
Ugly Naked Guy's taking
his turkey out of the oven.

289
00:19:11,772 --> 00:19:14,332
Oh, my God! He's not alone.

290
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:15,641
Ugly Naked Guy. . .

291
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:18,725
. . .is having Thanksgiving
dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.

292
00:19:20,572 --> 00:19:22,290
I gotta see this!

293
00:19:25,452 --> 00:19:27,408
All right, Ugly Naked Guy!

294
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:30,287
Ugly naked dancing!

295
00:19:31,132 --> 00:19:33,407
It's nice that he has someone.

296
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:44,881
Shall I carve?

297
00:19:45,932 --> 00:19:46,967
By all means.

298
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:55,885
Who wants light cheese,
and who wants dark cheese?

299
00:19:56,852 --> 00:19:59,685
I don't even want to know
about the dark cheese.

300
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:02,681
-Does anybody want to split this?
-I will.

301
00:20:02,932 --> 00:20:04,331
You guys have to make a wish.

302
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:06,162
Make a wish?

303
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:08,482
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.

304
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:15,605
You got the bigger half!
What did you wish for?

305
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:18,084
The bigger half.

306
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:22,482
All right, I'd like to
propose a toast.

307
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,883
A little toast here. Ding, ding!

308
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:28,245
This isn't exactly the kind of
Thanksgiving you planned. . .

309
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:32,121
. . .but for me this has
been really great.

310
00:20:32,372 --> 00:20:35,682
I think because it didn't
involve divorce. . .

311
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:37,484
. . .or projectile vomiting.

312
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:41,410
If you had gone to Vail. . .

313
00:20:41,652 --> 00:20:45,088
. . .or if you had been with your
family, or if you didn't have. . .

314
00:20:45,772 --> 00:20:47,171
. . .syphilis and stuff. . .

315
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:51,290
. . .we wouldn't be
all together.

316
00:20:51,492 --> 00:20:54,006
So I guess what I'm trying
to say is. . .

317
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:58,882
. . .I'm very thankful that all
of your Thanksgivings sucked.

318
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:03,089
-That's so sweet!
-Thank you.

319
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:07,288
Here's to a lousy Christmas!

320
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,488
And a crappy New Year!
