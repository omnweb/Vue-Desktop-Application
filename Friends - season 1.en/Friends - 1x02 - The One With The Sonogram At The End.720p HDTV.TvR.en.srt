1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,040
What you guys don't understand is, for us,

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:05,680
kissing is as important as any part of it.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,200
Yeah, right!

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,280
You serious?

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,800
Oh, yeah!

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,200
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,280
Absolutely.

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,880
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,480
like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's
like the stand-up comedian you have to sit

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,880
through before Pink Floyd comes out.

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,080
Yeah, and-and it's not that 
we don't like the comedian,

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,000
it's that-that... that's not

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,200
why we bought the ticket.

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,480
The problem is, though, after the concert's
over, no matter how great the show was,

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,000
you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know?

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,880
I mean, we're in the car,
we're fighting traffic... basically

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,600
just trying to stay awake.

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,800
Yeah, well, word of advice: 
Bring back the comedian.

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,638
Otherwise next time you're
gonna find yourself

20
00:00:56,639 --> 00:01:00,800
sitting at home, listening
to that album alone.

21
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,200
Are we still talking about sex?

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,600
FRIENDS

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,200
102 The one whith
the sonogram at the end

24
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,240
No, it's good, it is good, 
it's just that... mm...

25
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,360
Doesn't she seem a little angry?

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,840
Well, she has issues.

27
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,360
Does she.

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,160
He's out banging other women over the
head with a club, while she sits at home

29
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,760
trying to get the mastodon 
smell out of the carpet!

30
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,320
Marsha, these are cave people. Okay?

31
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,240
They have issues like...

32
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,640
'Gee, that glacier's
getting kinda close.' See?

33
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,760
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
No. No.

34
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,440
Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!

35
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,160
Okay, okay, yes, it is.

36
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,840
How about I'll, uh, catch up 
with you in the Ice Age.

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,600
Hi.

38
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,800
So.

39
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,400
You look great. I, uh...

40
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,600
I hate that.

41
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,120
Sorry. Thanks.

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,200
You look good too.

43
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,200
Ah, well, in here, 
anyone who...

44
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
stands erect...

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,800
So what's new? Still, uh...

46
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,200
A lesbian?

47
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,320
Well... you never know.

48
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,320
How's, um... how's the family?

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,320
Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh...

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Why... why are you here, Carol?

51
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,200
I'm pregnant.

52
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,600
Pregnant?!

53
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company
where there's some kind of misunderstanding.

54
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,360
Then I've already seen this one!

55
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,680
Are you through with that?

56
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,480
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing 
slowed me down.

57
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,280
Whose little ball of paper is this?!

58
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,360
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a
note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it,

59
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,360
so I balled it up and... 
...now I wish I was dead.

60
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,697
She's already fluffed that pillow...

61
00:04:13,698 --> 00:04:16,460
Monica, you know, you've 
already fluffed that...
...but, it's fine!

62
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,360
Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give
them any more ammunition than they already have.

63
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,280
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent

64
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,360
can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.

65
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,280
Monica... Hi! 
Um, Monica, you're scaring me.

66
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,760
I mean, you're like, you're like all
chaotic and twirly.

67
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,280
And not-not in a good way.

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,680
Yeah, calm down.

69
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,480
You don't see Ross getting all
chaotic and twirly every time they come.

70
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,680
That's because as far as my parents are
concerned, Ross can do no wrong.

71
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,560
Y'see, he's the Prince.

72
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,960
Apparently they had some
big ceremony before I was born.

73
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,680
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
What?

74
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:01,694
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!

75
00:05:02,995 --> 00:05:04,234
Eeaagh!

76
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,680
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Yeah, it's beautiful.

77
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,640
Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....

78
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,320
No, look, don't touch that!

79
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,920
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow
enough, having to give it back to him...

80
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,720
'Hi Barry! Remember me? 
I'm the girl in the veil

81
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,720
who stomped on your heart 
in front of your entire family!'

82
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,240
Oh God and now I'm gonna have to 
return the ring, without the ring,

83
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,720
which makes it so much harder...

84
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,240
Easy Rach, we'll find it. 
Won't we!

85
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,320
Oh! Yeah!

86
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,720
Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?

87
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,320
Doy! 
Probably right before she lost it!

88
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,520
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...

89
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,920
I know I had it this morning,

90
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,240
and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...

91
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,040
...Dinah?

92
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,120
Ohhhhh, don't be mad...

93
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,440
You didn't.
Oh, I am sorry...

94
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,440
I gave you one job!

95
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,840
Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!

96
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,440
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you
look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...

97
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,240
I just... can't do it.

98
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,000
Boys?

99
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,880
We're going in.

100
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,080
Hi.

101
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,080
Wow. That is not a happy hi.

102
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,800
Carol's pregnant.

103
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,400
Ooh! I found it!

104
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,400
W... w... wh... 
wha... w... w... w...

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,600
Yeah. Do that for another two hours,

106
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,180
you might be where I am right about now.

107
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,200
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in
perspective, huh, Mon?

108
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,400
Well now, how...
how do you fit into this whole thing?

109
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,200
Well, Carol says she and Susan want me
to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable

110
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,880
with it, I don't have to be involved..

111
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,680
basically it's entirely up to me.

112
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,880
She is so great! I miss her.

113
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,680
What does she mean by 'involved'?

114
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,600
I mean presumably, the biggest part of
your job is done.

115
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,600
Anyway, they want me to go down to this...

116
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,280
sonogram thing with them tomorrow.

117
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,480
So what are you gonna do?

118
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,080
I have no idea.

119
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,280
No matter what I do, though,
I'm still gonna be a father.

120
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,240
.....Well, this is still ruined, right?

121
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,840
Oh, Martha Ludwin's
daughter is gonna call you.

122
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,560
Mmm! What's that curry taste?

123
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,440
Curry.
Mmmm!

124
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,560
I- I think they're great! I, I really do.

125
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,640
Do you remember the Ludwins?
The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?

126
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,840
They all had a thing for him.

127
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,240
Aw, Mom...

128
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,640
I'm sorry, why is this 
girl going to call me?

129
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,760
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants
 to be something in cooking, or food, or...

130
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,960
I don't know.

131
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,360
Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant...

132
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,360
No Mom, I don't have a restaurant,
I work in a restaurant.

133
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,840
Well, they don't have to know that...

134
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,160
Ross, could you come and help me
with the spaghetti, please?

135
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,840
Yeah.
Oh, we're having spaghetti!

136
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,240
That's.... easy.

137
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,360
I know this is going to sound 
unbelievably selfish,

138
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,440
but, were you planning on bringing
up the whole baby/lesbian thing?

139
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,640
Because I think it might take 
some of the heat off me.

140
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,120
What that Rachel did to her life...
We ran into her parents at the club,

141
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,400
they were not playing very well.

142
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,720
I'm not gonna tell you what
they spent on that wedding...

143
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,320
but forty thousand dollars
 is a lot of money!

144
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,600
Well, at least she had the
chance to leave a man at the altar...

145
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,000
What's that supposed to mean?

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,400
Nothing!

147
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,400
It's an expression.
No it's not.

148
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,000
Don't listen to your mother.
You're independent, and you always have been!

149
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,920
Even when you were a kid...

150
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,800
and you were chubby, and you had 
no friends, you were just fine!

151
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,320
And you would read alone in your room,
and your puzzles...

152
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,200
Look, there are people like Ross
who need to shoot for the stars,

153
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,200
with his museum,
and his papers getting published.

154
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,600
Other people are satisfied with
staying where they are...

155
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,120
I'm telling you,
these are the people who never get cancer.

156
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,720
And I read about these women 
trying to have it all,

157
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,600
and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica'
doesn't seem to have that problem.

158
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,200
So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?

159
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,960
No news, no little anecdotes 
to share with the folks?

160
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,280
Okay! Okay.
Look, I, uh... I realise you guys

161
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,280
have been wondering what exactly

162
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,560
happened between Carol and me, and,
so, well, here's the deal.

163
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,280
Carol's a lesbian.

164
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,880
She's living with a woman named Susan.

165
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,560
She's pregnant with my child, and she and

166
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,280
Susan are going to raise the baby.

167
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
And you knew about this?!

168
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,480
Your folks are really that bad, huh?

169
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,880
Well, y'know, these people are pros.

170
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,480
They know what they're doing,
they take their time,

171
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,160
they get the job done.

172
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,880
Boy, I know they say
you can't change your parents...

173
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,680
boy, if you could...
I'd want yours.

174
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,440
Must pee.

175
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,120
Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.

176
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,640
You're twins?
Yeah. We don't speak.

177
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,640
She's like this high-powered, 
driven career type.

178
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,240
What does she do?
She's a waitress.

179
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,840
All right, you guys, 
I kinda gotta clean up now.

180
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Chandler, you're an only child, right?
You don't have any of this.

181
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,520
Well, no, although I did have an 
imaginary friend, who...

182
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,720
my parents actually preferred.

183
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
The lights, please...

184
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
How long was I in there?

185
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,240
I'm just cleaning up.

186
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,520
D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?

187
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,120
Uh.. okay, sure!
Thanks!

188
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,120
Anyway.. um..

189
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,720
So, you... uh... 
you nervous about Barry tomorrow?

190
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,240
Oh.. a little.. 
Mm-hmm.. A lot.

191
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,840
Mm.
So, got any advice?

192
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,840
Y'know, as someone who's 
recently been... dumped?

193
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,920
Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'.

194
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,920
Chances are he's gonna be this,
this broken shell of a man, y'know,

195
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,280
so you should try not to look too terrific,
I know it'll be hard.

196
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,400
Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll 
give Barry back his ring,

197
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,000
and you can go with 
Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...

198
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,680
Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow...

199
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,880
When did it get so complicated?

200
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,280
Got me.

201
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,200
Remember when we were
in high school together?
Yeah.

202
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,680
I mean, didn't you think you were just
gonna meet somone, fall in love...

203
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,680
and that'd be it?

204
00:13:25,474 --> 00:13:28,974
...Ross?
Yes, yes!

205
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,600
Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..

206
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,280
Me neither...

207
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,080
Hi. Sorry I'm late,
I was stuck at work.

208
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,200
There was this big dinosaur... thing...
anyway.

209
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,560
Hi.

210
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,440
Ross, you remember Susan.
How could I forget?

211
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,140
Ross.
Hello, Susan.
 Good shake. Good shake.

212
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,160
So, uh, we're just waiting for...?

213
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,360
Dr. Oberman.
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he...

214
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,640
She.
...she, of course

215
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,960
She... uh... familiar with our...
special situation?

216
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,160
Yes, and she's very supportive.

217
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,160
Okay, that's great.

218
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,160
No, I'm... Oh.

219
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,240
Thanks.

220
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,040
Ross? That opens my cervix.

221
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,440
Barry?

222
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,960
C'mon in.

223
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,040
Are you sure?

224
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,360
Yeah! It's fine, it's fine.
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

225
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,640
So, how ya doin?

226
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,600
I'm... uh...

227
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,920
I'm okay...

228
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,600
You look great!

229
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,120
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.

230
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,920
Be right there.
Be back in a sec.

231
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,320
I dumped him.
Okay.

232
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,120
So, um... so how's this, uh,
how's this gonna work?

233
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,320
Y'know, with us?

234
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,320
Y'know, when, like, important 
decisions have to be made?

235
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,400
Give me a 'for instance'.

236
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,200
Well, uh, uh, I don't know, 
okay, okay,

237
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,120
How about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
-Marlon!
-Marlen?

238
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,720
...if it's a boy, 
Minnie if it's a girl.

239
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,520
...As in Mouse?

240
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,400
As in my grandmother.

241
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,520
Still, you... you say Minnie, 
you hear Mouse.

242
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,600
Um, how about, um...

243
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,600
how about Julia?

244
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,200
Julia.

245
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,400
We agreed on Minnie.

246
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,200
'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend
the rest of our lives together.

247
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,080
Things change, 
roll with the punches.

248
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,760
I believe Julia's on the table...?

249
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,880
Sorry about that.

250
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,280
So. What have you been up to?

251
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,080
Oh, not much.

252
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,680
I... I got a job.

253
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,160
Oh, that's great.

254
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,760
Why are... why are you so tanned?

255
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,160
Oh, I, uh... I went to Aruba.

256
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,560
Oh no.
You went on our honeymoon alone?

257
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,280
No.

258
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,560
I went with, uh..
Now, this may hurt.

259
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,880
Me?!

260
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,080
No!
I went with Mindy.

261
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,560
Mindy?

262
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,280
Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!

263
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,680
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.

264
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,560
Oh! Well, um..
You've got plugs!

265
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,280
Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.

266
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,280
And you've got lenses!

267
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,760
But you hate sticking 
your finger in your eye!

268
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,360
Not for her.

269
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,860
Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
Okay...

270
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,320
See, about a month ago,
I wanted to hurt you.

271
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,720
More than I've ever wanted to 
hurt anyone in my life.

272
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
And I'm an orthodontist.

273
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,040
You know, you were right?

274
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,040
I mean, I thought we were happy.

275
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,840
We weren't happy.

276
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,520
But with Mindy, now I'm happy.

277
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,120
Spit.

278
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,320
What?

279
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,520
Me.

280
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,520
Anyway, um,

281
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,240
I guess this belongs to you.

282
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,240
And thank you for giving it to me.

283
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,120
Well, thank you for giving it back.

284
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,520
Hello?!

285
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,320
Oh, please! 
What's wrong with Helen?

286
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,920
Helen Geller?

287
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,040
I don't think so.

288
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,320
Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

289
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,720
Thank you!

290
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,840
No, I mean it's not Geller.

291
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,040
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?

292
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,240
No, actually, um,
we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.

293
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,840
Well, wait a minute, wha...
why is she in the title?

294
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,640
It's my baby too.

295
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,120
Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember
you making any sperm.

296
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,480
Yeah, and we all know 
what a challenge that is!

297
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,200
All right, you two, stop it!

298
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,280
No no no, she gets a credit, hey,
I'm in there too.

299
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,200
Ross. You're not actually suggesting
Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller?

300
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,800
'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.

301
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,400
Of course not, I'm... 
suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.

302
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,000
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? 
He knows no-one's gonna say all
those names, so they'll wind up calling her
Geller, then he gets his way!

303
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,480
My way?! 
You... you think this is my way?

304
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,080
Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined
this moment in my life being, this is not my way...

305
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,680
y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard.
I'm not, I can't do...

306
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,400
How are we today?
Any nausea?

307
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,680
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
A little.

308
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,080
Well, I was just wondering about the 
mother-to-be, but... thanks for sharing.

309
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,200
Uh, lie back..

310
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,400
You... uh... y'know what, 
I'm gonna go.

311
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,200
I don't... I don't think I can be involved in this
particular thing right now.

312
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,200
Oh my God.

313
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,800
Look at that.

314
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,280
I know.

315
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
Well? Isn't that amazing?

316
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,960
What are we supposed to be seeing here?

317
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,960
I dunno, but... I think it's 
about to attack the Enterprise.

318
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,160
You know, if you tilt your head to the left,

319
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,840
and relax your eyes,
it kinda looks like an old potato.

320
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,240
Then don't do that, alright?
Okay!

321
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,460
Monica. Whaddya think?
Mm-hmm.

322
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,160
Wh... are you welling up?

323
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,360
No.

324
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,640
You are, you're welling up.
Am not!

325
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,440
You're gonna be an aunt.
Oh shut up!

326
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,840
Hi, Mindy.

327
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,960
Hi, it... it's Rachel.

328
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,240
Yeah, I'm fine. I... 
I saw Barry today.

329
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,360
Oh, yeah, yeah he... he told me.
No, no, it's okay.

330
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,760
I hope you two are very happy,
I really do.

331
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if...if

332
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,760
everything works out, and you guys end
up getting married and having kids...

333
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,840
and everything... 
I just hope they have his old
hairline and your old nose.

334
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,960
Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now.
