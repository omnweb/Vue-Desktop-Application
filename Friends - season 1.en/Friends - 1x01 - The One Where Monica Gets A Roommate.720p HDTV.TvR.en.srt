1
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:48,391
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

2
00:00:48,952 --> 00:00:51,272
You're going out with the guy.

3
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:52,625
There has to be something
wrong with him.

4
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:55,453
So does he have a hump
and a hairpiece?

5
00:00:57,746 --> 00:00:59,113
Wait, does he eat chalk?

6
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:03,168
I don't want her to go through
what I did with Carl.

7
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:04,517
Okay, everybody relax.

8
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:06,522
This is not even a date.

9
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:09,256
It's just two people going out
to dinner and not having sex.

10
00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:10,874
Sounds like a date to me.

11
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:16,318
I'm in high school,
in the cafeteria..

12
00:01:17,449 --> 00:01:19,547
and I realize I'm totally naked.

13
00:01:20,673 --> 00:01:21,678
I've had that dream.

14
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,275
Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone...

15
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:27,635
there.

16
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:30,506
- Instead of
- That's right!

17
00:01:31,472 --> 00:01:32,363
Never had that one.

18
00:01:33,215 --> 00:01:35,148
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

19
00:01:37,192 --> 00:01:38,307
And it turns out it's my mother.

20
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:43,951
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

21
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:53,692
He says, "Hello,"
I want to kill myself.

22
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:56,506
You okay?

23
00:01:57,164 --> 00:01:58,745
I feel like someone pulled my
intestine out of my mouth...

24
00:01:59,673 --> 00:02:03,300
and tied it around my neck.
- Cookie?

25
00:02:05,947 --> 00:02:07,002
Carol moved her stuff out today.

26
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:09,646
- Let me get you some coffee.
- Thanks.

27
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:18,016
No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

28
00:02:19,687 --> 00:02:21,550
- Just leave my aura alone, okay?
- Fine, be murky.

29
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:26,323
- I'll be fine. I hope she'll be happy.

30
00:02:27,086 --> 00:02:27,510
No, you don't.

31
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:28,580
To hell with her. She left me!

32
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:32,565
And you never knew she was a lesbian.

33
00:02:36,392 --> 00:02:40,719
Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

34
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,750
She didn't know.
How should I know?

35
00:02:47,773 --> 00:02:49,431
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

36
00:02:51,783 --> 00:02:52,886
Did I say that out loud?

37
00:02:55,748 --> 00:02:59,027
Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

38
00:02:59,915 --> 00:03:01,192
You're angry. You're hurting.

39
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:02,903
Can I tell you what
the answer is?

40
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:05,652
Strip joints!

41
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:12,091
See, but I don't want
to be single, okay?

42
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,662
I just want to be married again.

43
00:03:19,124 --> 00:03:21,327
And I just want a million dollars!

44
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,782
Rachel?

45
00:03:25,383 --> 00:03:28,313
Oh, God, Monica!
Hi! Thank God!

46
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:29,746
I went to your building and
this guy with a hammer said...

47
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:31,479
...that you might be here and you are.

48
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:35,097
-Can I get you some coffee?
-Decaf.

49
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,808
Everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

50
00:03:41,703 --> 00:03:44,089
This is everybody.
Chandler and Phoebe..

51
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:46,509
...and Joey. And remember
my brother, Ross?

52
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:47,574
Sure!

53
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:59,845
You want to tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

54
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:05,575
Oh, God! Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

55
00:04:07,196 --> 00:04:09,015
I was in this room with
all the presents...

56
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:14,346
This really gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat.

57
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,572
When all of a sudden I realize...

58
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:17,100
Sweet 'N Low?

59
00:04:17,438 --> 00:04:19,765
I realized...

60
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,424
...I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.

61
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,170
And then I really freaked out,
when it hit me:

62
00:04:25,172 --> 00:04:27,691
How much Barry looks like
Mr. Potato Head.

63
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:30,570
I always knew he looked
familiar, but. . . .

64
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:37,748
I had to get out of there,
and I started wondering. . .

65
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:39,716
. . . ''Why am I doing this?''
and ''Who am I doing this for?''

66
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:44,735
I didn't know where to go, and I know
you and I have drifted apart. . .

67
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:48,038
. . .but you're the only person
I know in the city.

68
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,257
Who wasn't asked to the wedding.

69
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,598
I was kind of hoping that
wouldn't be an issue.

70
00:05:07,393 --> 00:05:09,129
I guess he bought her
the pipe organ. . .

71
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,869
. . .and she's really not
happy about it.

72
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:16,647
Daddy, I just--
I can't marry him.

73
00:05:16,962 --> 00:05:17,786
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:18,394 --> 00:05:19,431
I just don't love him.

75
00:05:20,747 --> 00:05:22,803
Well, it matters to me!

76
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:28,704
She should not be
wearing those pants.

77
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:31,408
I say push her down the stairs!

78
00:05:32,258 --> 00:05:35,596
Push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!

79
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:41,446
Come on, Daddy, listen!

80
00:05:41,697 --> 00:05:44,469
All my life, everyone's
always told me, ''You're a shoe! ''

81
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,467
''You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe! ''

82
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:50,556
I stopped and said,
''What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

83
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:53,843
What if I want to be a purse?

84
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:55,376
Or a hat?''

85
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,407
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I--

86
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:00,807
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

87
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:04,627
You can see where he'd have trouble.

88
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:09,913
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

89
00:06:11,556 --> 00:06:13,473
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

90
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:18,827
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

91
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:22,598
Well, maybe that's my decision.

92
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:25,733
Well, maybe I don't need your money.

93
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:27,970
Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

94
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,150
Just breathe.
Breathe, that's it.

95
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:39,591
Just try to think
of nice, calm things.

96
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:41,988
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

97
00:06:42,787 --> 00:06:44,819
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

98
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:47,942
La la la something
And noodles with string

99
00:06:52,848 --> 00:06:53,271
-These are a--
-I'm all better now.

100
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:56,698
I helped.

101
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:01,198
This is probably for
the best, you know?

102
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,770
Independence.
Taking control of your life.

103
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:08,152
If you need anything,
you can always come to Joey.

104
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:11,836
Me and Chandler live across the hall.
And he's away a lot.

105
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:16,081
Joey, stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.

106
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,180
What? Like there's
a rule or something?

107
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:23,208
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

108
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,817
It's Paul.

109
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,140
Buzz him in.

110
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:27,879
-Who's Paul?
-Paul, the wine guy?

111
00:07:28,842 --> 00:07:30,185
Maybe.

112
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:33,594
Your ''not a real date,''
is with Paul, the wine guy?

113
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:35,014
He finally asked you out?

114
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:37,241
It's a ''Dear Diary'' moment.

115
00:07:39,134 --> 00:07:41,271
Rach, I can cancel.

116
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:42,604
Oh, God. Please, no.
Go, I'll be fine.

117
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:44,822
Ross are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?

118
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,723
That'd be good.

119
00:07:49,454 --> 00:07:51,868
-Really?
-Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

120
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:58,468
Hi, come in! Paul, this is. . .

121
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:02,091
. . .everybody.
Everybody, this is Paul.

122
00:08:02,711 --> 00:08:07,156
-The wine guy.
-I didn't catch your name. Paul?

123
00:08:08,418 --> 00:08:09,633
Change. Sit down.
Two seconds.

124
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:16,715
I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

125
00:08:19,661 --> 00:08:21,438
Rachel, what are you
up to tonight?

126
00:08:22,276 --> 00:08:26,091
I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon. . .

127
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:27,826
. . .so, nothing.

128
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:31,279
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

129
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:36,419
Although, Aruba. This time of year?
Talk about your. . .

130
00:08:38,262 --> 00:08:39,410
. . .big lizards.

131
00:08:43,951 --> 00:08:45,972
If you don't feel
like being alone tonight. . .

132
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,388
. . .Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

133
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,625
And we're very excited about it.

134
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:56,727
Thanks. But I'm just gonna
hang out here.

135
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,168
-It's been a long day.
-Okay. Sure.

136
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,905
Pheebs, wanna help?

137
00:09:01,228 --> 00:09:01,954
I wish I could, but I don't want to.

138
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:12,844
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things. . .

139
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:16,317
. . .using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

140
00:09:17,895 --> 00:09:21,559
I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever. . .

141
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,702
. . .and I cannot feel my legs.

142
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,904
-Which goes where?
-I have no idea.

143
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,569
-Done with the bookcase.
-All finished.

144
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,317
This was Carol's favorite beer.

145
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:44,784
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

146
00:09:46,623 --> 00:09:47,922
Let me ask you a question.

147
00:09:48,227 --> 00:09:51,593
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

148
00:09:52,485 --> 00:09:53,447
What did you get?

149
00:09:54,483 --> 00:09:55,306
You guys.

150
00:09:55,588 --> 00:09:56,885
-You got screwed.
-Oh, my God.

151
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:00,465
-Oh, my God.
-I know. I'm such an idiot.

152
00:10:01,658 --> 00:10:05,547
I should've caught on when she went to
the dentist four and five times a week.

153
00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:07,936
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

154
00:10:08,445 --> 00:10:11,346
My brother's going through that.
He's a mess.

155
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:12,332
How did you get through it?

156
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:16,771
He might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers.

157
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:18,129
-Say her--
-Leg?

158
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,622
That's one way of going through it.
Me, I went for the watch.

159
00:10:21,976 --> 00:10:23,872
You actually broke her watch?

160
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:27,408
Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

161
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:31,942
You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

162
00:10:32,195 --> 00:10:34,659
It's about me.
And I just--

163
00:10:41,853 --> 00:10:43,762
Machine cut me off again.
Anyway. . . .

164
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:50,802
You know what's scary? What if there
is only one woman for everybody?

165
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:53,492
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

166
00:10:54,602 --> 00:10:58,357
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

167
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:01,723
What are you talking about?
One woman.

168
00:11:02,984 --> 00:11:05,743
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

169
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:09,843
Let me tell you something.
There's lots of flavors out there.

170
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:14,936
Rocky road, and cookie dough,
and bing cherry vanilla.

171
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:18,482
You can get them with jimmies,
or nuts, or whipped cream.

172
00:11:19,517 --> 00:11:22,056
This is the best thing that
ever happened to you!

173
00:11:22,677 --> 00:11:25,477
You got married. You were
like, what? Eight?

174
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,212
Welcome back to the world.
Grab a spoon!

175
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:33,918
I honestly don't know
if I'm hungry or horny.

176
00:11:34,687 --> 00:11:35,925
Then stay out of my freezer.

177
00:11:39,101 --> 00:11:41,867
Ever since she
walked out on me, I. . . .

178
00:11:42,642 --> 00:11:46,054
What? What?

179
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:47,255
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

180
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:50,202
It's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

181
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,665
So there's going to be a fifth date?

182
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:56,054
Isn't there?

183
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,774
Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

184
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:01,767
What were you going to say?

185
00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:08,592
Ever since she left me. . .

186
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:12,485
. . .I haven't been able to perform. . .

187
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:14,904
. . .sexually.

188
00:12:17,888 --> 00:12:19,109
Oh, God! Oh, God!

189
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:21,700
I'm so sorry.

190
00:12:21,902 --> 00:12:23,446
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

191
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:27,727
How long?

192
00:12:28,144 --> 00:12:29,173
Two years.

193
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:34,227
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

194
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,493
So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

195
00:12:42,017 --> 00:12:44,659
Yeah, I do.

196
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:57,864
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

197
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,855
''Grab a spoon. ''

198
00:13:02,304 --> 00:13:04,237
Do you know long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

199
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,468
Do the words, ''Billy, don't be a
hero,'' mean anything to you?

200
00:13:09,912 --> 00:13:13,438
You know, here's the thing. Even if
I could get it together enough. . .

201
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:15,585
. . .to ask a woman out. . .

202
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:18,383
. . .who am I going to ask?

203
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:40,305
Isn't this amazing?

204
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:43,090
I have never made coffee
before in my life.

205
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:45,861
-That is amazing.
-Congratulations.

206
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,400
If you feel like you gotta make
a Western omelet or something. . . .

207
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:55,539
Although, actually
I'm really not that hungry.

208
00:13:57,904 --> 00:13:59,032
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

209
00:14:01,522 --> 00:14:03,522
-Morning.
-Morning, Paul.

210
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:06,053
-Hello, Paul.
-Hi. Paul, is it?

211
00:14:11,064 --> 00:14:12,209
Last night was like. . .

212
00:14:13,256 --> 00:14:14,992
-Thank you so much.

213
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:17,248
We'll talk later.

214
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:24,157
Thank you.

215
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:32,066
That wasn't a real date.

216
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,751
What the hell do you do
on a real date?

217
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:39,116
Shut up and put my table back.

218
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:42,774
I've got to get to work.

219
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,990
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

220
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,308
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

221
00:14:54,152 --> 00:14:55,580
Yeah, we all have jobs.

222
00:14:56,297 --> 00:14:58,140
That's how we buy stuff.

223
00:14:59,787 --> 00:15:00,807
Yeah, I'm an actor.

224
00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:04,021
Have I seen you in anything?

225
00:15:04,343 --> 00:15:06,027
I doubt it.
Mostly regional work.

226
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:09,539
Unless you happen to catch the
Wee One's production of Pinocchio...

227
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:12,258
''Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy. ''

228
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:16,692
I will not take this abuse.

229
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:18,508
You're right. I'm sorry..

230
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:21,435
Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

231
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:28,317
How are you doing today?
You sleep okay?

232
00:15:28,756 --> 00:15:30,705
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

233
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:34,762
I see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

234
00:15:40,871 --> 00:15:42,794
I know. He's just so--

235
00:15:44,535 --> 00:15:45,839
Remember you and Tony De Marco?

236
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:48,967
Well, it's like that.
With feelings.

237
00:15:50,821 --> 00:15:52,542
-Are you in trouble!

238
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:57,930
I'm going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him all day.

239
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:01,114
Or else I'm just going
to get up and go to work.

240
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,087
-Wish me luck!
-What for?

241
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,264
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

242
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:17,284
-Hey, Monica.
-Hey, Franny. Welcome back.

243
00:16:17,703 --> 00:16:19,431
How was Florida?

244
00:16:19,743 --> 00:16:20,841
You had sex, didn't you?

245
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:24,684
How do you do that?

246
00:16:24,909 --> 00:16:26,431
So, who?

247
00:16:26,933 --> 00:16:28,212
You know Paul?

248
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:30,094
Paul, the wine guy?

249
00:16:30,896 --> 00:16:32,040
Yeah, I know Paul.

250
00:16:34,142 --> 00:16:36,636
You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

251
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:39,091
Are you kidding?
I take credit for Paul.

252
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,770
Before me, there was no snap in his
turtle for two years.

253
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:47,790
Of course it was a line.

254
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:51,494
Why? Why would anybody
do something like that?

255
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:54,703
We're looking for an answer
more sophisticated than. . .

256
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:56,383
. . . ''To get you into bed. ''

257
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,497
Is it me?

258
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,408
Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs. . .

259
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:05,359
. . .and men with emotional
problems can hear?

260
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:07,752
Come here.
Give me your feet.

261
00:17:15,064 --> 00:17:16,898
I just thought he was
nice, you know?

262
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:22,085
I can't believe you
didn't know it was a line.

263
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:27,450
Guess what?

264
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:29,385
-You got a job?
-Are you kidding?

265
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:31,110
I'm trained for nothing.

266
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:34,473
I was laughed out of 12 interviews.

267
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:36,760
You're surprisingly upbeat.

268
00:17:37,046 --> 00:17:39,875
You would be too if you found
Joan and David boots on sale. . .

269
00:17:40,516 --> 00:17:41,518
. . .50% percent off.

270
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,471
How well you know me.

271
00:17:45,734 --> 00:17:47,994
They're my, ''I don't need
a job or my parents.

272
00:17:48,305 --> 00:17:49,633
I've got great boots,'' boots.

273
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:53,505
-How did you pay for them?
-Credit card.

274
00:17:54,294 --> 00:17:55,522
And who pays for that?

275
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,191
My father.

276
00:18:00,593 --> 00:18:02,630
You can't live off your parents.

277
00:18:03,036 --> 00:18:05,867
I know that. That's why
I was getting married.

278
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:09,473
Give her a break. It's hard being
on your own for the first time.

279
00:18:09,908 --> 00:18:11,540
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

280
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:14,122
When I first came to
this city, I was 1 4.

281
00:18:14,352 --> 00:18:16,613
My mom had killed herself
and my stepdad was in prison.

282
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:19,232
And I got here,
and I didn't know anybody.

283
00:18:19,654 --> 00:18:23,963
I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields.

284
00:18:24,143 --> 00:18:27,629
And then he killed himself.

285
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:31,491
Then I found aromatherapy. Believe
me, I know exactly how you feel.

286
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:36,381
The word you're looking for is:

287
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:39,635
''Anyway. . . . ''

288
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,733
You ready?

289
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:46,059
-I don't think so.

290
00:18:46,237 --> 00:18:51,391
Cut, cut, cut.

291
00:18:54,906 --> 00:18:57,025
Welcome to the real world!

292
00:18:57,426 --> 00:18:59,119
It sucks.
You're gonna love it.

293
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:07,509
That's it.

294
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,130
You gonna crash on the couch?

295
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:13,012
-No, I gotta go home sometime.
-Are you gonna be okay?

296
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:17,618
Look what I just
found on the floor.

297
00:19:19,613 --> 00:19:20,756
What?

298
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:22,879
That's Paul's watch.

299
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,165
You can just put it back
where you found it.

300
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:28,302
Oh, boy! All right.

301
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,516
-Good night, everybody.
-Good night.

302
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:43,155
-I'm sorry.
-No!

303
00:19:44,693 --> 00:19:45,525
-No, have it, really.
-Split it?

304
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:53,718
You probably didn't know this,
but back in high school I had. . .

305
00:19:54,842 --> 00:19:55,703
. . .a major crush on you.

306
00:19:57,742 --> 00:19:58,664
I knew.

307
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,143
You did?

308
00:20:01,946 --> 00:20:04,695
I figured you thought I was
Monica's geeky older brother.

309
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,399
I did.

310
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:12,979
Listen, do you think--

311
00:20:13,618 --> 00:20:17,149
And try not to let my vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here.

312
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:20,487
Do you think it would be okay if
I asked you out sometime, maybe?

313
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:26,976
Maybe.

314
00:20:35,051 --> 00:20:36,169
Okay, maybe I will.

315
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,963
-Good night.
-Good night.

316
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:57,252
See you.

317
00:20:59,235 --> 00:21:00,171
Wait, wait.

318
00:21:00,784 --> 00:21:01,935
What's with you?

319
00:21:03,872 --> 00:21:05,509
I just grabbed a spoon.

320
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:15,923
I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

321
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:17,558
I can't believe what
I'm hearing.

322
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,697
-What? I said you had--
-What? I said you had--

323
00:21:21,025 --> 00:21:21,885
Would you stop?

324
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,633
Was I doing it again?

325
00:21:25,934 --> 00:21:27,479
Would anybody like more coffee?

326
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:31,847
Did you make it?

327
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,910
-I'm just serving it.
-I'll have a cup of coffee.

328
00:21:36,018 --> 00:21:37,611
Kids, new dream.

329
00:21:37,941 --> 00:21:39,132
I'm in Las Vegas.

330
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:40,458
I'm Liza Minnelli.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
